SCOPE OF PROJECT

Weather Application:

Requirements:

User should be able to enter the name of a city.
The application should fetch the current weather information for that city using a weather API (you can use OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, etc.).
Display the current temperature, weather condition, and any other relevant information.
Allow the user to choose between displaying the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
Provide a simple and intuitive user interface.


Potential Features to Add:

Forecast: Extend the application to display a weather forecast for the next few days.
Graphical Representation: Use a library like Matplotlib to create a graphical representation of the temperature trend over the next few days.
Geolocation: Allow the user to get the weather information based on their current location.
History: Implement a feature to show the user's search history.


Tips:

Start by exploring the weather API documentation to understand how to make requests and what data you can get.
Break down the project into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time.
Use functions to modularize your code. For example, you might have separate functions for getting weather data, displaying information, handling user input, etc.
Consider using a graphical user interface library like Tkinter or PyQt if you want to create a desktop application. Alternatively, you can create a web-based interface using Flask or Django.
Don't hesitate to search for help online or ask for guidance if you get stuck. There are many resources and communities available to support Python learners.
